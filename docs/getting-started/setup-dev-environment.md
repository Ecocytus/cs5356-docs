title: Set Up your Dev Environment

We'll be using a lot of JavaScript in the course - in a browser environment & using NodeJS for a terminal environment.

## Browsers

Chrome & Firefox are great choices for browsers with good developer tooling. In class, I'll be showing most of my examples with Chrome.
Avoid using Safari Developer Tools, its not worth the annoyance :shrug:.

## Install NodeJS
Install Node v18 (the current Long Term Support release) using the installer for your particular platform - https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/Links

If you already have a NodeJS installation, or you want to install multiple versions of NodeJS, then you can use a tool like [nvm (node version manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
